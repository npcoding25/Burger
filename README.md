## Objective 

To create a burger app where you can add and 'eat' a burger using a MVC framework and handlebars.js.

## Functionality

Once on the webpage the user is presented with a burger image, a list of burgers on the left side, an 'Already eaten!' burger section on the right, and an input area to add new burgers. The list of burgers each have a 'Devour It!' button and once clicked they will move to the 'Already eaten!' section.
